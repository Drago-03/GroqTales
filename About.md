# GroqTales: Groq-Powered NFT Story Generator on Monad - Project Overview

**Document Version:** 1.1
**Date:** April 15, 2025
**Author:** Drago
**Platform Name:** GroqTales

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the concept, architecture, and prototype development guide for **GroqTales**, a cutting-edge platform that empowers users to create unique, AI-generated stories and mint them as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Monad blockchain. Leveraging the high-performance capabilities of Groq's Language Processing Units (LPUs) via GroqCloud for fast and efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference, **GroqTales** aims to provide a seamless and engaging storytelling experience, culminating in verifiable ownership of user-created content. The name **GroqTales** directly reflects the core technology powering the platform (Groq) and its primary function (generating tales or stories).

## 2. Project Goals

* **Empower User Creativity:** Provide an intuitive platform for users to generate stories based on their prompts and ideas.
* **Leverage Groq's Performance:** Utilize GroqCloud for rapid and high-quality text generation through advanced LLMs, a key differentiator of **GroqTales**.
* **Enable Digital Ownership:** Allow users to mint their generated stories as unique NFTs on the Monad blockchain, granting them verifiable ownership and potential for future utility or monetization within the **GroqTales** ecosystem.
* **Foster a Creative Community:** Build a platform where users can discover, share, and appreciate each other's AI-generated stories created on **GroqTales**.
* **Early Focus on Text:** Initially concentrate on text-based stories to streamline the prototype development of **GroqTales**, with potential for multimedia integration (images, audio) in later phases.

## 3. Core Features

1.  **Story Generator (Groq-Powered):**
    * Users input creative prompts to initiate story generation within **GroqTales**.
    * Users select a genre for their story (e.g., Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Mystery). This genre will be used as a parameter to guide the Groq-powered LLM during generation within **GroqTales**.
    * Leverages GroqCloud for fast and efficient text generation using state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., LLaMA 3, Mixtral), a defining feature of **GroqTales**.
    * Outputs a base story in text format within the **GroqTales** interface.

2.  **NFT Minting (on Monad via GroqTales):**
    * Users can choose to mint their generated story as an NFT through the **GroqTales** platform.
    * **GroqTales** handles the process of uploading the story text (and potentially metadata) to decentralized storage (IPFS).
    * Metadata in JSON format is generated by **GroqTales**, including the story text's IPFS link, selected genre, creator information (wallet address), and potentially other relevant details. This metadata is also uploaded to IPFS by **GroqTales**.
    * A Solidity-based smart contract deployed on the Monad blockchain is interacted with by **GroqTales** to mint a new NFT. The NFT's metadata URI points to the generated metadata on IPFS.

3.  **Story Gallery (on GroqTales):**
    * A public space within **GroqTales** where users can browse and view minted story NFTs created by others.
    * Displays story titles, genres, and potentially previews within the **GroqTales** interface.
    * Basic interaction features like likes, shares, and comments (data stored off-chain within **GroqTales**).

4.  **Creator Profiles (on GroqTales):**
    * Dedicated pages within **GroqTales** showcasing the NFTs created by individual users, retrieved based on their connected wallet address.

```

# Detailed Steps:

1. User Logs In via Wallet (MetaMask): The user connects their MetaMask wallet to the GroqTales frontend for authentication and to interact with the Monad blockchain.

2. Enters a prompt: The user provides a creative prompt through a text input field on the GroqTales interface.

3. Choose Genre: The user selects a relevant genre for their story from a predefined list (e.g., Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Mystery) on the GroqTales frontend.

4. Backend: Send Prompt + Genre to GroqCloud: The frontend sends the user's prompt and selected genre to the GroqTales backend API. The backend then constructs a request to the GroqCloud API, including the prompt and genre to guide the LLM generation.

5. Backend: Receive Generated Story (Text): The GroqTales backend receives the generated text story from the GroqCloud API.

6. Frontend: Display Story & "Mint" Button: The generated story is displayed to the user on the GroqTales frontend, along with a "Mint" button.

7. User Clicks "Mint": The user clicks the "Mint" button to initiate the NFT creation process.

8. Backend: Prepare Metadata (Story Text, Genre, Creator): The GroqTales backend gathers the necessary information for the NFT metadata: the generated story text, the selected genre, the user's wallet address (obtained from the authenticated session), and a timestamp.

9. Backend: Upload Metadata (and Story Text if large) to IPFS: The backend creates a JSON metadata file containing the gathered information. If the story text is large, it is uploaded to IPFS, and its CID is included in the metadata. The metadata JSON file itself is then uploaded to IPFS.

10. Backend: Get IPFS Metadata URI: The backend retrieves the IPFS URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) of the uploaded metadata JSON file.

11. Frontend: Initiate Mint Transaction on Monad: The GroqTales frontend uses a library like ethers.js or a Monad-specific SDK to initiate a transaction to the deployed NFT smart contract on the Monad blockchain. This transaction calls the mint function of the smart contract, passing the IPFS Metadata URI as an argument. The user will be prompted to sign this transaction with their MetaMask wallet.

12. Monad Blockchain: Mint NFT (points to Metadata URI): The Monad blockchain processes the mint transaction. Upon successful confirmation, a new NFT is created, and its metadata URI is set to the provided IPFS URI, effectively linking the NFT to the story's metadata and content.

13. Backend: Update Database with NFT Information: The GroqTales backend updates its database (MongoDB) to record the newly minted NFT, associating it with the user's wallet address, the IPFS metadata URI, and potentially other relevant details.

14. Frontend: Display Story on User Profile & Public Gallery: The GroqTales frontend retrieves the metadata for the newly minted NFT (by querying the backend or potentially directly interacting with the blockchain and IPFS) and displays the story (text and genre) on the user's profile page and in the public gallery for other users to discover.


### Techstack and Prototype Development Guide

The following tech stack will be used to build GroqTales, along with a guide on how to approach the prototype development.

5.1 Tech Stack


### Frontend:
- React
- Next.js (for SSR and API routes)
- shadcn/ui (for UI components)

### AI Engine:
- GroqCloud (Groq's cloud API for LLMs)

### NFT Minting:
- Solidity (for Monad smart contracts)

### Media (Simplified):
- Focusing on images (generated by AI or uploaded) and text (generated by Groq). We'll skip FFmpeg and complex audio/video processing for now. PIL/Canvas might still be useful for basic image manipulation if needed.

### Backend:
- Node.js (with Express) OR FastAPI (Python) - Choose one based on team preference.

### Storage:
- IPFS (for decentralized storage of images and potentially large text content if needed)

### Wallet Auth:
- MetaMask (primary wallet for interacting with Monad in this prototype)

### Hosting:
- Vercel (for Frontend)
- Render (for Backend)

### Database:
- MongoDB (NoSQL database for user data, story metadata, NFT information)
