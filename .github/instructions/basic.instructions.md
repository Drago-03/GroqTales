Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. **Project Structure**: Understand the overall structure of the project, including key directories and files.
2. **Coding Standards**: Follow established coding standards and best practices for the programming languages and frameworks used in the project.
3. **Documentation**: Refer to existing documentation for guidance on project-specific conventions and requirements.
4. **Testing**: Ensure that any code changes are accompanied by appropriate tests and that all tests pass before changes are merged.
5. **Collaboration**: Communicate effectively with team members and seek feedback on proposed changes.
6. **Version Control**: Use version control best practices, including meaningful commit messages and proper branching strategies.
7. **Security**: Adhere to security best practices to protect sensitive data and prevent vulnerabilities.
8. **Performance**: Consider performance implications of code changes and optimize where necessary.
9. **Accessibility**: Ensure that the code adheres to accessibility standards to provide an inclusive experience for all users.
10. **Compliance**: Follow any relevant legal and regulatory requirements that apply to the project, including data protection and privacy laws.
11. **Code Reviews**: Participate in code reviews, providing constructive feedback and being open to suggestions for improvement.
12. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Utilize CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes, ensuring that code changes are integrated smoothly and efficiently.
13. **Issue Tracking**: Use the project's issue tracking system to document bugs, feature requests, and other tasks, ensuring that all work is tracked and prioritized appropriately.
14. **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop with users and stakeholders to gather insights and improve the project iteratively.
15. **Learning and Adaptation**: Stay updated with the latest developments in the technologies used and be willing to adapt practices as new information or tools become available.
These guidelines should be followed to ensure that the project is developed efficiently, meets quality standards, and aligns with the overall goals of the organization. The AI should generate code and responses that are consistent with these principles, facilitating a collaborative and productive development environment.
