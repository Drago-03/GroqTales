# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to GroqTales! This guide will help you quickly create your first AI-generated story or NFT. If you haven't set up GroqTales yet, please follow the [Installation Guide](Installation.md) first.

## Step 1: Launch GroqTales

Ensure your local development server is running. If not, navigate to the project directory and start it:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the GroqTales application.

## Step 2: Connect a Wallet (Optional for NFTs)

If you plan to mint your story as an NFT, connect a cryptocurrency wallet like MetaMask:

1. Click on the "Connect Wallet" button in the header or within the story generator page.
2. Follow the prompts to connect your wallet. Ensure you're on a supported network (e.g., Monad Testnet).

If you're just creating a story to share for free, you can skip this step.

## Step 3: Navigate to AI Story Generator

From the homepage, navigate to the "Create" section or directly to the AI Story Generator page by clicking on the appropriate link in the navigation menu.

## Step 4: Create Your First Story

1. **Set Story Parameters**: Choose a genre (e.g., Fantasy), provide a title (optional), and add a brief overview or prompt for the AI.
2. **Customize (Optional)**: Expand the story outline section to add details about characters, setting, plot, or themes for a more tailored story.
3. **Generate Story**: Click the "Generate Story" button to let the AI create your story based on your inputs.

Once generated, you'll see the story content displayed on the page. You can edit or regenerate it if needed.

## Step 5: Publish or Mint as NFT

- **Publish for Free**: If you want to share your story with the community without minting, click "Publish Story" to make it available on GroqTales.
- **Mint as NFT**: If you've connected a wallet and want to create a unique digital asset, switch to the "Mint as NFT" tab and click "Mint as NFT". Follow the prompts to confirm the transaction on the blockchain.

## Step 6: Share and Engage

After publishing or minting, your story will be accessible in your profile or the community gallery. Share the link with others, engage with feedback, and explore stories from other creators.

## Tips for Success

- **Experiment with Prompts**: The more specific your prompt, the more tailored the AI's output will be. Try different genres or detailed scenarios.
- **Review Before Minting**: Ensure your story is exactly how you want it before minting as an NFT, as blockchain transactions are permanent.
- **Join the Community**: Connect with other users for inspiration and collaboration via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Drago-03/GroqTales/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/your-invite-link).
