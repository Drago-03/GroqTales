### Your Approach:

- **Why you chose this problem**: We chose this problem to merge the power of AI with blockchain technology, creating a unique platform for storytellers to not only generate creative content but also own and monetize it as NFTs. The intersection of AI and blockchain offers a novel solution to digital content ownership and creativity.
- **Key challenges you addressed**: Integrating Groq AI for high-quality story generation, ensuring seamless NFT minting on the Monad blockchain, and designing an intuitive user interface for story customization and wallet connection were major challenges. We also focused on handling API rate limits and ensuring secure wallet interactions.
- **Any pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking**: Initially, we focused solely on text stories, but during brainstorming, we pivoted to include comic-style stories with panel-by-panel breakdowns. A breakthrough came with implementing streaming responses from Groq API for real-time story generation feedback, enhancing user experience.

## üß™ How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- **Node.js**: Version 16.x or higher for running the Next.js application.
- **API Keys**: Groq API key for AI story generation (optional, but recommended for custom usage). Unsplash API key for image placeholders (optional).
- **Wallet**: A crypto wallet (like MetaMask) installed and configured to connect to the Monad blockchain for NFT minting and story publishing.
- **.env file setup**: Required for storing API keys and environment variables. Use the provided `.env.example` as a template.

### Local Setup:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/mantej-arora/GroqTales

# Navigate to the project directory
cd GroqTales

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env.local file based on the .env.example template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local to add your API keys
# For example:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
# NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_API_KEY=your_unsplash_api_key_here
# NEXT_PUBLIC_MONAD_NETWORK_ID=your_monad_network_id_here

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

**Additional Setup Notes**:
- **Frontend/Backend Split**: The project uses Next.js for both frontend and backend (API routes). Ensure API routes in `pages/api/` are correctly configured if extending functionality.
- **Wallet Connection**: To test NFT minting or story publishing, connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and ensure it's set to the Monad network. The app will prompt for network switching if needed.
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive keys must be stored in `.env.local`. Do not commit this file to version control.
